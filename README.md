# Cloud Classification using Deep Learning
Clouds are beguiled and may influence lives of human beings unknowingly in their day to day life. Clouds are not only the impress of quotidian climate but also valve of weather. Shallow clouds play an important role in the subtropical wind regions by balancing global energy is a big question for science of climate. A common misinterpretation of the shallow clouds is that they can organize themselves into large patterns which are frequently perceived from satellite imagery. Researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) and the Laboratoire Météorologie Dynamique (LMD), France, have categorized ten thousand satellite images in four types of classification named as flower, fish, sugar and gravel. The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning algorithm to identify the existence of patterns of cloud by studying the human labels.
